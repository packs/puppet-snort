#### Logging & Alerting

# NOTE: NO_PACKET_LOG and BINARY_LOG, ALERTMODE, etc. are mutually
# exclusive. Use either NO_PACKET_LOG or any/all of the other logging
# options. But the more logging options use you, the slower Snort will run.


# Where should Snort log?
# -l {/path/to/logdir}
# config logdir: {/path/to/logdir}

# Should Snort dump the application layer data when displaying packets in
# verbose or packet logging mode.
# -d
# config dump_payload

# Should Snort keep binary (AKA pcap, AKA tcpdump) logs also? This is
# recommended as it provides very useful information for investigations.
# -b
# output log_tcpdump: {log name}
BINARY_LOG=0

# Should Snort turn off packet logging?  The program still generates
# alerts normally.
# -N
# config nolog
NO_PACKET_LOG=0

# Print out the receiving interface name in alerts.
# -I
# config alert_with_interface_name
PRINT_INTERFACE=0

# When dumping the stats, what log file should we look in

# To add a BPF filter to the command line uncomment the following variable
# syntax corresponds to tcpdump(8)
